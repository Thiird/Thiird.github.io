Dated 28th of May 2025.

Written around 9 am while at work.
I listened to music on youtube while at work, and this music popped up.
I got the necessary inspiration/visualization and got to work.  
Tearful moments followed.

I don’t hide for a moment that this is what I would like to be read to me at my funeral.
I picture a person reading this while standing in front of my coffin.  
The reading is done slowly, with pauses in between the sentences: there isn’t much to be said, but the words weigh a lot, so time is needed to emphasize that.

I initially called it an atheist prayer, but it really has nothing to do with atheism.
It's simply about properly taking care of the passing of the person.

The sentence _"You are the shoulder..."_ is a reference to the common saying _We rest on the shoulder of giants_: there is space and need for everybody to be a giant.
