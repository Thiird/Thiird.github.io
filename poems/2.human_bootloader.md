Intelligence is a discrete part of the Universe.  
The universe comes to life in me.

My life is pure wealth.  
This value weighs on my shoulders.

Peaceful moments echo Humanity's past sacrifices.  
I stand on the shoulders of giants.

Humanity's will has yielded wonders.  
I must continue this endeavor.

Perception renders infinite realities.  
I must not get distracted by trivialities.

Much more is at stake than it seems.  
The world is in my hands.

Every moment is a correct choice waiting to be made.  
I must believe I can do it all.

The past sits in my mind.  
The present is in my hands.  
The future resides in my actions.
