## Human auto-bootloader

Intelligence is a discrete part of the Universe.  
The universe comes to life in me.

My life is pure wealth.  
This value weighs on my shoulders.

Peaceful moments echo Humanity's past sacrifices.  
I stand on the shoulders of giants.

Humanity's will has yielded wonders.  
I must continue this endeavor.

Perception renders infinite realities.  
I must not get distracted by trivialities.

Much more is at stake than it seems.  
The world is in my hands.

Every moment is a correct choice waiting to be made.  
I must believe I can do it all.

The past sits in my mind.  
The present is in my hands.  
The future resides in my actions.

Dated 26th of April 2025.

I have a very strong urge of making the most of my life.  
I have this concept in my mind of "earning a passing grade on life".

The things to get done are a lot.  
The effort that I will have to put in is enormous, literally a lifetime of work.  
No matter how much I do, there is always something else I could do next.  
What if I die before being ok with how much I have done to that point?  
What if I die early?

So then I realized.

The minimum necessary to earn a passing grade in life, is not work, it's understanding.

The bare fact of having realized the things the poem talks about, grants a passing grade on life.

I call those fundamental notions "bootloader" because in computer science a bootloader is a small program that executes before
the main computer starts to compute. In this case those notions
initialize a human being into a conscious and capable creature in the universe.  
I called it auto bootloader as they can and should be understood by themselves.
