## Last moments

The room is full, people keep coming.

Each take their turn.  
A slow, meaningful handshake and a look in the eye.  
Then it's onto the next one.  
There is no time, he is fading.

Even before the inevitable, he won't let go.  
How could he? Too much is at stake.

The suffering is immense, and unjust.  
He quickly blinks, hoping the next is the last.  
No need for more, the last one was it.

They have seen it happen.  
Suddenly the world feels a little heavier.  
Silence reigns as their minds get rewired.

Death is both a blessing and a curse.  
It curses the subject with destruction.  
It blesses the bystanders with comprehension.
