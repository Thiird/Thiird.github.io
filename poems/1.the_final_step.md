## The Final Step

It's time to cross the door of the end of life, I feel an immense pitiful sensation.

No amount of work done or love received can make me accept not having another day of possibilities ahead of me: I really could have done more, it really could have been better.

Relief is nowhere to be found.

I understood and cherished the preciousness of life, so no matter this endless unfulfillment, I don't deserve to suffer, not for this.

I use this last realization to charge for a moment, and push myself to make a step.

<span style="color: #99999996;">_He forces a step to cross the door._</span>  
<span style="color: #99999996;">_He is no more._</span>  
<span style="color: #99999996;">_Fading already, only a memory remains._</span>
