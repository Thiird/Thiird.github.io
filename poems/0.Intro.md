# Intro

This is a collection of poems and letters that I started writing in 2025.

This need for writing came to me naturally as I guided myself to think things through and get to the bottom of things.
I started writing with the goal of making up my mind about something. You know the feeling when you feel something and it feels important but you can't really utter it out? That is me when I start a new text. I need to get something out, and I share it on the internet because I believe there is real wisdom in what I write.

Some of these texts, and it's not too hard to figure out which, I wrote to put my mind at peace.

I spend a lot of time on the internet. Listening to people VLOGS and written posts online made me realize that.

We all know, although subconsciously, what's the truth, what really matters.
None of us knows the full story, but collectively? Yes, I believe we do.

I tried my best to put what I know to be true and valuable in these text, both for me to have a clear view on them and for others to learn from.

To put it poetically: here is my part of the collective enlightenment.
