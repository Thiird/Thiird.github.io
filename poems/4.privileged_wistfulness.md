## Privileged wistfulness

At some point in life, it's inevitable to look back.

Missed opportunities, faded relationships and what-ifs strongly unsettle the mind.

Pondering such things is a sign of physical safety, emotional intelligence and intellectual integrity.

May the awareness of this privilege bring your mind relief.
