# Background
I was born and raised in the Verona province, northern Italy.

As a little kid I first got into computers when a family friend from the USA gifted us a computer. I still remember the black CRT monitor and black ball-tracking mouse.

My education has always been Computer Science focused, from high-school to University.

I started with embedded systems in 2020 when I accidentally discovered the field online.
I got hooked up very quickly.
I built a macropad, then a keyboard, then a better keyboard, then a mouse, then I landed my first job (thanks to the mouse).

I'm currently working as an Embedded Systems Engineer in Bologna, Italy.

# My personality, hobbies and interests

I’m a very attentive, self-critical and innerly emotional person.  
I like to be in order, on time, and know how things work down to the single atom. This attention to details is what draws me to embedded systems, where single bits matter.

My brain works like a computer, I don't work well without data and I work best with known patterns.
This works against me when I'm not dealing with computers.

I rode a Suzuki DRZ-400 SM that I passionately maintained for six years.
I dabble in tennis, calisthenics, running, powerlifting and weightlifting.
I write poems and publish them on this website. I like to think that in doing so, I'm _"contributing to Humanity’s collective enlightenment"_.

I can enjoy a surprisingly varied amount of music, from [emotional 1 beat-per-century track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jE917VpQ-M) to stupid [230 beats-per-minute hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRB3HdR6-r8&t=100s).

Some of my favorite movies are _Tron Legacy_, _Sunshine_, _Interstellar_, _Iron Man_.

I'm a very curious person. I love to ask questions.

I’m a huge fan of technology and I take great pride for being in a position where I get to study and develop it.

What I aspire to do in life is to sustain my existence, the one of the people around me and pave the way for our legacy.
