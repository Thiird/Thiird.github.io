# Professional Skills
I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with formal education in Computer Science.  
My role centers on embedded software and firmware, but I am also very much involved in the electronics side of things, as I'm interested in all aspects of embedded systems development, including manufacturing and product lifecycle.

## Programming
My main languages are C, C++ and Python.  
On the firmware side, I have worked with MCU platforms like ATMega and nRF52, tools like the nRF Connect SDK and Zephyr RTOS and communication protocols like BLE, USB, SPI, I2C and UART. On the embedded software side instead, I have worked with Yocto-based Embedded Linux systems for which I developed user-space applications and the required system programming to support them.

## Electronics & Hardware
Electronics wise, I design PCBs with KiCAD: 2/4 layers, schematic design, PCB layout and component selection. I'm familiar with circuit design principles like power management, voltage regulation and basic signal integrity principles. I have hands-on experience with PCB assembly/rework (SMD/THT) and lab tools like oscilloscopes and multimeters.

Mechanics wise, I work with Fusion360 to create enclosures and mechanical pieces, both 3D printed and CNC'd aluminum.

## Creative Skills
In my high school years I dabbled in VFX, CG, and video editing.  
You can find some of my work on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stenicolis) and [ArtStation profile](https://www.artstation.com/stefano_nicolis).
