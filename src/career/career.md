# Professional Skills
I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with formal education in Computer Science. My role centers on embedded software and firmware, but I am also very much involved in the electronics side of things, as I'm interested in all aspects of embedded systems development, including manufacturing and product lifecycle.

## Programming
My main languages are C, C++ and Python.  
On the firmware side, I have worked with MCU platforms like ATMega and nRF52 using the nRF Connect SDK and Zephyr RTOS, and communication protocols like BLE, USB, SPI, I2C and UART. On the embedded software side, I have experience with Embedded Linux and system programming for user-space applications.

## Electronics & Hardware
I started building hardware in 2020.  
Electronics wise, I design PCBs with KiCAD: 2/4 layers, schematic design, PCB layout, component selection, manual assembly and rework. I'm familiar with circuit design principles like power management, voltage regulation, and basic signal integrity. I have hands-on experience with PCB assembly/rework (SMD/THT) and most lab tools like oscilloscopes and multimeters.

Mechanics wise, I work with Fusion360 to create enclosures and mechanical pieces, both 3D printed and CNC'd aluminum.

## Creative Skills
In my high school years I dabbled in VFX, CG, and video editing.  
You can find some of my work on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stenicolis) and [ArtStation profile](https://www.artstation.com/stefano_nicolis).
