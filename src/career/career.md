# Professional Skills
I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with formal education in Computer Science. My role centers on embedded software and firmware, but I maintain a strong skill set and interest in the electronics side as I enjoy working in all the aspects of embedded systems development.

## Programming
My main languages are C, C++ and Python.  
I have worked with MCU platforms like nRF52, STM32, ATMega using tools like nRF Connect SDK and Zephyr RTOS. I have experience with Embedded Linux, system programming for user-space applications and communication protocols: BLE, USB, SPI, I2C and UART.

## Electronics & Hardware
I started building hardware in 2020.  
Electronics wise, I design PCBs with KiCAD: 2/4 layers, schematic design, PCB layout, component selection, manual assembly and rework. I'm familiar with circuit design principles like power management, voltage regulation, and basic signal integrity. I have hands-on experience with PCB assembly/rework (SMD/THT) and most lab tools like oscilloscopes and multimeters.

Mechanics wise, I work with Fusion360 to create enclosures and mechanical pieces, both 3D printed and CNC'd aluminum.

## Creative Skills
In my high school years I dabbled in VFX, CG, and video editing.
