# Professional Skills
I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with formal education in Computer Science. My role centers on embedded software and firmware, but I maintain a strong skill set and interest in the electronics side.

I like to call myself a Full-Stack Embedded Systems Engineer, as I maintain skills, passion, and interest in working at all levels of embedded systems development.

## Programming
My main languages are C, C++ and Python.

I have worked with microcontroller platforms like nRF52, STM32, ATMega using tools like nRF Connect SDK and Zephyr RTOS.

I have experience with Embedded Linux and System Programming for application development and communication protocols like BLE, USB, SPI, I2C and UART.

## Electronics & Hardware
I started developing my electronics skills in 2020.

I design PCBs with KiCAD: 2/4 layers, schematic design, PCB layout, component selection, manual assembly and rework.

I'm familiar with circuit design principles like power management, voltage regulation, and basic signal integrity.

I have hands-on experience with PCB assembly/rework (SMD/THT) and most lab tools like oscilloscopes and multimeters.

I have also dabbled in mechanical engineering for enclosure design, both 3D printed and CNC Aluminum.

## Creative Skills
In my high school years I also dabbled in VFX, CG, and video editing.
