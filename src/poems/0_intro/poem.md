# Intro

This is a collection of personal writings, mainly poems.

The poems are mostly about describing reality through quick sentences, while pursuing a particular visual shape for the overall text.

Some of these texts, and it's not too hard to figure out which, I wrote to put my mind at peace.

The need for writing came to me naturally as I guided myself to think things through and get to the bottom of things. I always start from casual notes, whenever I get a good idea for conveying things in my mind.

We all know, although subconsciously, what's the truth, what really matters. None of us knows the full story, but collectively? Yes, I believe we do. I try my best to put what I know to be true and valuable in these texts, both for me to have a clear view on them and for others to learn from.

To put it poetically: here is my part of the collective enlightenment.
