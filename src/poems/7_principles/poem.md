This is my best assessment of what constitutes the principles for a good life.  
They are laid out in descending importance order.  
If I were a messiah, these would be my three commandments.

<br>

<strong><em>Seek Knowledge</em></strong>
Information is <em>needed</em> to operate in life.  
With it, the proper action can be taken to achieve practically anything.  
Always be on the lookout for the next information.  
Failing to do so will result in the denial of life-changing knowledge.  
We are all one piece of information away from changing our life for the better.  
Seek knowledge: you are always missing out on what you don't know

<br>

<strong><em>Seize Time</em></strong>
Time is the currency of life.  
You can buy some, maybe a lot, but entrophy wins in the end.  
It flows regardless of will, which is both a blessing and a curse.  
Seize time: there is always tomorrow, until there is not.

<br>

<strong><em>Cherish People</em></strong>
People are so ubiquitous we tend to filter them out.  
Nonetheless, they make us what we are.  
Recognition makes efforts worthwhile.  
Encouragement inspires greater heights.  
Feedback offers reflection.  
Love soothes oblivion.  
Cherish People: they where there for you, so while you can, it's important to reciprocate.
