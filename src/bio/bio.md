# Present
I'm currently working as an Embedded Systems Engineer in Bologna, Italy.

When I'm not working, you will find me chatting with people online, working out with calisthenics and planning stuff.
I used to be an avid PC gamer, but nowadays I mostly play just to meet people or for the nostalgia.

# Background
I was born and raised in the Verona province, northern Italy.

As a little kid I first got into computers when a family friend from the USA gifted us a computer. I still remember the black CRT monitor and black ball-tracking mouse.

My education has always been Computer Science focused, from high-school to University.

I started with embedded systems in 2020 when I accidentally discovered the field online. I got hooked up very quickly. I built a macropad, then a keyboard, then a better keyboard, then a mouse and then I landed my first job (thanks to the mouse).

# My personality, hobbies and interests
I'm a very attentive, self-critical and innerly emotional person.  
I like to be in order, on time, and know how things work down to the single atom. This attention to details is what draws me to embedded systems, where single bits matter.

I rode a <span tt="drz400">Suzuki DRZ-400 SM</span> that I passionately maintained for six years.
I dabble in tennis, calisthenics, running, powerlifting and weightlifting.
I write poems as a way to put into writings what I believe to be true and important. They are published on this website <em>(Writings -> Personal)</em>.

I can enjoy a surprisingly varied amount of music, from <span tt="sad-music">emotional 1 beat-per-century track</span> to stupid <span tt="crazy-music">230 beats-per-minute hardcore</span>.

Some of my favorite movies are _Tron Legacy_, _Sunshine_, _Interstellar_, _Iron Man_.

I'm a <em>very</em> curious person, I love to ask questions. Some people might say I ask too many.

I'm a huge fan of technology and I take great pride for being in a position where I get to study and develop it.

What I aspire to do in life is to sustain my existence, the one of the people around me and pave the way for my legacy.
