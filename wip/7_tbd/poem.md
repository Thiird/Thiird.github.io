## Sad inevitability

<span tt="1">Alive in a dead Universe.</span>

<span tt="2">Miracolously, encounters happen.</span>

<span tt="3">Yet.</span>
<span tt="4">
Much is necessary to stay together.<br>
Little is sufficient to split apart.
</span>

<span tt="5">
Unwilling to be together.<br>
Forced to share existence.
</span>

In interpersonal relationships, I have upset many people despite having the best intentions.  
Sometimes it was my fault, other times it was theirs.  
This poem expresses my sorrow of those situations.
