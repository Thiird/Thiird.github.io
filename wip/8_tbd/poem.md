## The necessity of love

The thought of one day being forgotten eats me alive.
It's not ego, It's a life-long effort going into oblivion.

Going forward means ignoring it.
Relief is nowhere to be found.

My body rejects that.
Delusion is unacceptable.

Love is the answer.

Its absence makes life unbearable.
Its presence blankets any preoccupation.
