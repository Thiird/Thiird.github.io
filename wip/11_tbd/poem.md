## Dealing with people

Living among people, we share the planet but not the world.

Awareness of this is important.
Lack of it divides us.

Trying to understand is crucial.
Listening is more important than speaking.

Not all worlds are created equal, though.
Boundaries must be in place.
Excess compassion harms more than none.

Jacob from IDA career

33 18 48 48 choose 4

Hi I got a call from Jacob to help review my CV

- Very far from standard CV and application: look at our material online!! webinars etc.
- only can give overall feedback, can follow up for specific application

CV (most important part of material, they spend 24 seconds look at it, if not good wont look at your cover letter):
X add profile picture, professional but no tie, ties are just for CEOs. Button shirt is enough.
X Links are ok, remove when born, move languages down
X - Name - email - phone numner
X Titles are "Bullshit bingos", remove the title just use a headline like "Experience in X Y Z"
- About me section should be in the top, call it "Profile section", most relevant experiences and position.
- "as an embedded system engineer, I can work at all levels of"
- Skills is a good section! Keep that, maybe call it Core Skills
X Work experience is ok, but use bullet points instead of detailed description
X Education is just fine, subjects are not that important, they cant relate, remove them. Maybe just say what compentences it gives you
X remove the grades, remove them!
X Personal Projects, ok but only if relevant to that specific company
X Languages section: mother tongue and fully professional level
X Personal Section at the bottom: but its about me, like hobbies, Here I need to demonstrate the reasons why I wanna move to Denmark, but not too personal
- You need to demonstrate that you are SERIOUS you stay there, tell them how serious you are, this is another barrier for me as an international

Cover Letter
- DOnt write it as a real letter, just an application page that encapsules me as a professional
- its all wrong, its just a repeat of the motivational letter (remove the years old)
X START FROM SCRATCH
X It has to have elements of looking at the future, whereas the CV looks to the past
X They read the letter bc the toolbox from the CV is OK!! now look at the future
- Do a headline
- Then a paragraph that is your "after seeing you job ad I can see how I can"
X right now I am actively relocating to the city as I fell in love with the country etc etc
- Then a paragraph with arguments: what an experience I have, where I got it from, how I can use in this position
- This experience will enable me to assist your company in bla bla
- Chatgpt copilot is my friends!! never copy paste just use a template
- The idea IS TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE AND FUTURISTIC
- NEW PARAGRAPH about skill and explain how they..
2 - 3 paragraph like this

AS an employees you will get a guy that is like this and that

Your sincerily

Stefano Nicolis

Basically:
-headline: specifically from the job ad
- 2 -3 paragramg abnout me and the future int he company (THE ARGUMENTS)
- final paragraph regarding me in job place and in the office
- closing thanks

------
should I share about my trips, YES IN THE ABOUT SECTION IN THE BOTTOM "eager to make a move ETC ETC"
profile picture where? top left or top right
cultural fit? "I am sorryto hear that... I would be curiosu to hear what specific.." DONT FEAR ASKING FOR DETAILS
can follow up?
getting interview means you match 70%-80%

Questions for Jacob:
- is it ok if I put an emphasis on "I did it alone" by saying "Complete ownership over X Y" in the CV bullet points?
I worry about sounding too cocky and not suited for working in teams

# Headline:
I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer from Italy eager to move and start a life in Denmark. I mainly focus on embedded software and firmware, but I am also very much involved in the electronics side of things as I'm interested in all aspects of embedded systems development, including manufacturing and product lifecycle. 

# Argument 1 - Professional Value
After seeing your job ad, I can see how my experience in [specific technology/area from job ad] and passion for [specific aspect from job ad] would enable me to contribute to [company goal/project mentioned in ad].

As an employee, you will work with someone who is attentive, self-critical, and passionate about embedded systems engineering. I am organized, and can work autonomously if needed. I take ownership of my work and care about the long term consequences of my engineering decisions.

I developed this "full-stack" perspective mainly through working at a startup during my Msc. I also cultivated this all-around awareness outside of formal settings because I wanted to progress faster. This drive led me to projects like the custom mouse cited in my CV, a project that required me to design a product end-to-end, completely independently while learning many of the required technologies from scratch.

I prefer to work on meaningful projects, and your company's mission aligns with that priority [insert details about specific company].

# Argument 2 - Personal Fit
On a personal level, you will get a colleague who is quiet during work hours, kind and focused on his work. Outside of work I am concerned with taking care of myself, my people and the things around me. I like to exercise, work on personal engineering projects, read, take walks and meet people.
Overall, I'm a very curious person, I love to ask questions and learn about anything, which I believe makes me easy to work with and contributes to a positive team environment.

# Argument 3
Why Denmark.
I want to move to Denmark because of career and cultural reasons. I like the danish career prospects and I find that I like being surrounded by pragmatic and discrete people, I know for a fact are common aspects of danish people. Besides that, many other things like weather, geographical location and anecdotal experiences made me settle on Denmark when evaluating where to settle in life.

I didn’t take this decision lightly, that's why I traveled to Denmark twice in 2025 to make sure that both I would fit in Denmark and Denmark would fit in me. I have been to Copenhagen and Aarhus for a three-day visit each, where I met with friends and immersed myself in the danish way of living. Besides that, I have a few danish friends I can reach out for help, in case I would need it.

Just to make it clear: I am sold out on Denmark. The only things holding me back are a job offer and my current job 5-week notice period.

I hope my excitement for this opportunity and for Denmark came through and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Have a nice day.

Stefano Nicolis
